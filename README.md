This is a case study from Versa Asia Internship.

Code written by: Mohamad Usamah Thani Bin Che Arif

Follow these steps to run the JavaScript script in Visual Studio Code and generate the output JSON file:


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en).


    
## Steps

### Using Terminal
1. Clone or Download Repository:
* Clone this repository or download the script (script.js) to your local machine.

2. Install Dependencies:
* Open a terminal in the project directory.
* Run the following command to install the required Node.js dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

3. Run the Script:
* Execute the following command in the terminal to run the script:

```bash
  node versa-asia-test.js
```

4. Verify Output:
* After the script execution, check the terminal for the message "The file was saved!".
* Verify that the `output.json` file has been generated in the project directory.

5. View Output:
* Open the `output.json` file to view the generated JSON content.


### Using "Run Code Button" in Visual Studio Code

Or simply using shortcut `CTRL + ALT + N`

## Troubleshooting
* In case of any issues, ensure that Node.js is properly installed and that you are running the script in the correct directory.

## Acknowledgments:

* The script utilizes the Node.js `fs` module for file system operations.
